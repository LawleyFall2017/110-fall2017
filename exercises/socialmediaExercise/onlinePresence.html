<h1 id="online-presence-exercise">Online Presence Exercise</h1>
<h2 id="part-1-create-a-linkedin-profile">Part 1: Create a LinkedIn Profile</h2>
<p>The social web takes many forms, including creating a personal online presence, participating in community and collaborative contexts, and curating content for others. You’re already engaging in community and collaborative work through your Google Docs activities in class, but this week’s exercise will focus on your personal online presence.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has become the de facto standard for professional presence in technical fields. It serves as an always-available online resume, and is often the first place potential employers will look when researching you.</p>
<p>If you already have a LinkedIn profile, great! If not, you will create one for this exercise. (If there is a reason why you are unable or unwilling to create a profile on LinkedIn, you will need to contact me and explain the circumstance.)</p>
<p>At a minimum, your profile should contain your name, your photo, your RIT affiliation, a summary (which should talk about the types of jobs you’re interested in getting) and any technical skills that you currently have. If you have relevant professional experience, you should add it here, as well.</p>
<p>When you’re finished, post a link to your profile in the <a href="https://lawley-110-2017.slack.com/messages/C88SHC28Y">#linkedinprofiles</a> channel in Slack</p>
<h2 id="part-two-how-much-does-google-know-about-you">Part Two: How Much Does Google Know About You?</h2>
<p>Have you tried searching for any traces of yourself in Google? I want you to do that today. It’s often not sufficient to just search for your name, because it’s likely that you’ll get a lot of “false hits.” Here are some tips for how to narrow your search to find things specific to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Google, put your name in quotes, and try multiple variations on your name. (e.g. “Elizabeth Lawley”, “Liz Lawley”, “Elizabeth Lane Lawley”, “E Lawley”) Make sure you check the images and news sections as well as the main search</li>
<li>If you have a username that you use on more than one site, try searching for that in Google as well as on the site in question</li>
<li>Add a location, school, or other affiliation
<ul>
<li>“Elizabeth Lawley” RIT, “Liz Lawley” Rochester, etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Search for your email address(es), your phone number(s), your street address(es), with and without your name</li>
<li>If you have a Facebook account, use the “View As” option on your timeline to see what someone who’s not friends with you is able to see</li>
<li>Search for your name, username, and/or email address on social sites like Facebook, Reddit, etc (To search for a username on Reddit, use author:<em>username</em>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h2>
<p>Write a 2-3 paragraph summary of what you found. How much information about yourself were able to locate? More than you expected? Less? Was there anything you were surprised to find? Anything that you chose to remove after finding? Anything that you would like to make more accessible? Upload the document to the dropbox in myCourses.</p>
