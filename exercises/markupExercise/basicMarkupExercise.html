            <div class="page-desc">
                <p>In today's exercise, you'll create the HTML document and file structure for a simple web page.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subhead" id="part1">
                <h2>Part 1: Creating the Folder and File Structure</h2>
                <i class="fas fa-angle-left" aria-label="expand/collapse arrow"></i>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">

                <p>On your computer (or on a USB drive) create a folder called RIT Web. Inside that folder, create a folder called www. Inside of the www folder, create a folder called igme110. And inside of the igme110 folder, create a folder called media. The www folder represents your www directory on RIT's web server, which we'll talk about more next week. The igme110 folder is where all of your exercises and projects for this class will be stored.</p>

                <img src="110homepage-folderstructure.png" alt="Folder structure screenshot" class="screenshot">

            </div>

            <div class="subhead" id="part2">
                <h2>Part 2: Creating Your First HTML Page</h2>
                <i class="fas fa-angle-left" aria-label="expand/collapse arrow"></i>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Open VS Code (or Brackets), select "Open..." from the File menu, and open the www folder that you just created. You should be able to see the igme110 folder in the file browser pane on the left. Select that folder, and then click on the "new file" icon to create a new file.</p>

                <img src="vscode-newfile.png" alt="VS Code New File Screenshot" class="screenshot">

                <p>If you're using VS Code, you can insert the basic structure for an HTML page by typing html:5 and then pressing enter. If you're using Brackets (or another editor, refer back to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML Basics</a> reading for how to create the basic structure for your document.</p>

                <p>In the title element in the head of the document, put the text "Your Name's First 110 HTML Page".</p>

                <p>In the body of the document, add a level 1 heading element containing your name. Below that, add a paragraph element that that includes a few lines about yourself. Save the file.</p>

                <img src="html1.png" alt="screenshot of initial html" class="screenshot">

                <p>Open a web browser, and in the browser use the File&rarr;Open command to locate and display the index.html file you just created. (Or, if you have previewing capability in your editor, you can use that.) It should look something like this:</p>

                <p><img src="browser1.png" alt="screenshot of starting page" class="screenshot"></p>

            </div>

            <div class="subhead" id="part3">
                <h2>Part 3: Adding an Image</h2>
                <i class="fas fa-angle-left" aria-label="expand/collapse arrow"></i>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">
                <p> Find a Creative Commons-licensed image on the web, or an image that you own the rights to, that you’d like to include on your page. Save it in your igme110 folder.</p>

                <p>You’re going to add code to your HTML to display the image on the web page. Add an img tag below the h1 element, and above the p element. For the src attribute, you're going to put the <em>relative</em> path to the image you downloaded. Because the image is in the same directory as your html file, the relative path is just the file name--if you don’t provide any other information besides a file name, the browser will assume that the image is in the same directory as the HTML file it’s displaying. That means this link will work when you're previewing your work on your hard drive, <em>and</em> once you've uploaded it to a web server. (We'll talk about that more next week.) The other required part of an img tag is the alt attribute, which contains text that will display if the browser is unable to display images. My image is a photo of my dog, Morgan, so my code now looks like this:</p>

                <img src="html2.png" alt="Screenshot with img tag" class="screenshot" />

                <p>Save your file, go back to the browser window that you used to view it in the last section, and reload the file. It should now look something like this:</p>

                <img src="browser2.png" alt="web page with image added" class="screenshot">

                <p>Reload your page in the browser; if your image isn’t showing up properly, ask for help now! (If it’s much too big to display properly on the page, try finding and downloading a smaller image from the web; on Thursday you'll learn how to resize the image properly using CSS).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subhead" id="part4">
                <h2>Part 4: Creating and Linking a Second Page</h2>
                <i class="fas fa-angle-left" aria-label="expand/collapse arrow"></i>
            </div>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Create a new HTML file in your igme230 directory, and name it page2.html. Give it a title of “Your Name’s Second HTML Page.” (Put that in the title tag, as well as in a level 1 heading on the page.)</p>

                <p>Find another image and save this one into the media folder that's inside the igme110 folder. To reference it in your img src, you'll need to include the folder name and the file name, like this: "media/yourimage.png"</p>

                <p>Add an unordered list underneath the image, with two list items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A full URL link to the original source of the image on the current page</li>
                    <li>A relative reference (file name only) to the index.html page</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's what my code looks like now:</p>

                <img src="html3.png" alt="second page html code" class="screenshot">

                <p>And here's how it looks in the browser:</p>

                <img src="browser3.png" alt="second page browser screenshot" class="screenshot">

                <p>Go back to your index.html file, and add a link to the source of the image on that page, and a link to the page2.html. (You can put these in a list again, or you can include them as part of a paragraph of text.)</p>

                <p>Test both your pages and make sure that the images and links work properly. </p>

                <p>You need to have either the TA or the professor check your work to get credit for this. You can do this in class on Tuesday, during office hours on Wednesday, or at the start of class on Thursday.</p>
